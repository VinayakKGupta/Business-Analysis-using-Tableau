## Key Insights ## 

Analysis was done on Global Wire Background Company which is a retail brand and dataset contains all products, customer, sales details and delivery details. 

**Product Insight**

Finding: The top 5 products (Others, Flats-Others, B207 2.5mm, XLPE Single Core, Versolex Single Core) contributed most to commercial margins, but their performance varied across states. For example, B207 2.5mm performed well in NSW, WA, QLD but poorly in SA, ACT, NT.

Business Impact: This showed that product demand was not uniform across regions. Some states were underperforming despite strong national sales, suggesting inefficiencies in product placement and marketing. By reallocating focus to states where products already perform well, the company could increase margins and reduce losses in weaker regions.

**Customer Insight**

Finding: The top 3 customers—Medicing ($8.65M), Formonix ($5.18M), and Branding ($5.06M)—generated the largest share of commercial margin. Their purchases were concentrated on key products like B207 2.5mm and Flats-Others, distributed differently across states.

Business Impact: This highlighted customer concentration risk but also revealed opportunities to strengthen ties with high-value customers. Tailoring state-specific strategies (e.g., focusing on VIC for Medicing, NSW for Formonix) could deepen relationships and drive further sales.

**Logistic Insight**

Finding: Transportation cost per tonne was significantly higher from VIC–NSW ($487.4/tonne) compared to VIC–WA ($281.4/tonne), despite NSW being geographically closer. Both states showed similar product demand and commercial margins.

Business Impact: The company was incurring unnecessarily high costs serving NSW compared to WA. Redirecting part of sales volume from NSW to WA could maintain margins while lowering logistics expenses, improving overall profitability.

**How the Potential Savings of $8.5M Was Calculated**

The calculation came from shifting sales volumes from NSW (high transport cost) to WA (lower transport cost).

Volumes from the report:

B207 2.5mm: 73,434T to NSW vs. 35,470T to WA

Flats-Others: 51,475T to NSW vs. 20,889T to WA

Since the transport cost difference is about $206/tonne ($487.4 – $281.4), redirecting a significant portion of tonnes from NSW to WA results in substantial savings.

Multiplying the tonnage reallocation by the cost difference gives the estimated $8.5M potential saving.
